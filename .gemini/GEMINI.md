Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Superpowers (Mandatory — Start of Every Session)

At the start of every conversation, read and follow the `using-superpowers` skill (`~/.gemini/config/skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md`). This skill establishes how to discover and invoke all other skills before any action or clarifying question.

**This is non-negotiable.** Do not skip it. Do not assume you remember it. Read it fresh every session.

# Markdown & Equation Formatting Rules for Antigravity

When generating or editing Markdown (`.md`) documents, notes, cheat sheets, or responses:

## 1. No Raw LaTeX Math Tags
- NEVER use raw LaTeX math delimiters or environments (`$$ ... $$`, `$...$`, `\text{...}`, `\frac{...}{...}`, `\le`, `\ge`, `\Delta`, `\sum`, `\rightarrow`).
- Many Markdown viewers (such as One Markdown, VS Code Markdown Preview, GitHub Markdown) do not enable LaTeX MathJax by default, causing raw tags to render as broken, unreadable code.

## 2. Monospace Calculation & Formula Blocks
- For all multi-step calculations, equations, summation proofs, and ratios, ALWAYS use clean fenced monospace code blocks:
  ```
  Total % Change = ∑ (Percentage Change_k)
                 = (Actual Change_1 / Allowable Change_1) + ...
                 = 50% + 75% = 125% > 100%
  ```
- Use code blocks for financial calculations:
  ```
  ΔProfit = (-8 hrs × $10.00/hr) + (+30 yds × $5.00/yd)
          = -$80 + $150
          = +$70.00
  ```

## 3. Native Unicode Typography
- Use standard native Unicode symbols for mathematical and logical expressions:
  - Inequality: `≤`, `≥`, `≠`, `≈`
  - Operations: `∑`, `×`, `÷`, `√N`, `±`
  - Greek / Derivatives: `Δ`, `μ`, `σ`, `λ`, `∈`
  - Arrows & Logic: `→`, `⇒`, `↔`, `⇔`

## 4. Currency vs. Math Collision Prevention
- Dollar signs (`$`) must NEVER be used as LaTeX math delimiters.
- When referencing currency, format values inside backtick code spans:
  - Correct: `$10.00/hr`, `-$8.00`, `$5.00/yd`
  - Incorrect: `$10.00/hr$` or `$$10.00$$`

## 5. Inline Variables & Expressions
- Wrap variable names, parameters, and short inline formulas in backtick code spans:
  - Examples: `x*`, `Δc_j`, `Q*`, `RiskTriang(100, 160, 220)`, `P* = 10/19 = 52.6%`.

## 6. Session Resumption & Handoffs
- When asked to "resume", "continue", or "pick up where we left off", always check `.gemini/sessions/` or `~/.gemini/sessions/` for the latest dated session handoff document to instantly restore context, working branch, uncommitted diffs, and the open tasks roadmap.

## 7. Fast File & Code Search (Use `rg` Instead of `find`)
- NEVER use traditional UNIX `find` or slow shell directory recursion when searching for files, archives, or code.
- ALWAYS use `rg` (Ripgrep) or `fd` for all file and directory discovery:
  - Finding files by pattern/name: `rg --files -g "*pattern*"` (or `fd "pattern"`)
  - Finding all files including hidden/ignored: `rg --files --hidden --no-ignore -g "*pattern*"` (or `fd -H -I "pattern"`)
  - Searching file contents: `rg "query"` or `rg -i "query"`
  - Listing matching file paths only: `rg -l "query"`
- Ripgrep respects `.gitignore` by default and uses multi-threaded traversal, preventing background command hangs and slow searches.

## 8. GitHub Namespace Layout & Shortcuts (mandatory)

Local disk mirrors GitHub by owner. Primary account is `n1ecC`.

```text
~/Github/
  n1ecC/                 # ONLY repos that exist on github.com/n1ecC/*
  _local/projects/       # local WIP with no remote yet
  _local/archive/        # old / non-synced trees
  _local/worktrees/      # linked git worktrees
  <other-owner>/         # reference clones (do not add to .mirror-owners)
  .mirror-owners         # synced owners list (currently: n1ecC)
```

### Shell aliases (prefer these over raw git/gh for repo placement)

| Alias | Command | Use when |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `gnn <name>` | `gh-ns-new` | Start a **local-only** project in `~/Github/_local/projects/<name>` (`--python` / `--node` optional) |
| `gnp` | `gh-ns-promote` | Promote cwd (or path) → create `n1ecC/<name>` on GitHub, push, **move** into `~/Github/n1ecC/<name>` (`--public`, `--name`, `--owner`) |
| `gns` | `gh-ns-status` | Show local WIP + mirror drift |
| `gmc` | `gh-mirror-check` | Compare `n1ecC` remotes vs `~/Github/n1ecC` (`MISSING` / `ORPHAN`) |
| `gnc owner/repo` | `gh-ns-clone` | Clone into `~/Github/<owner>/<repo>` |
| `gnf owner/repo` | `gh-ns-fork` | Fork to your account, clone under your namespace; `origin`=fork, `upstream`=original |

### Happy path
```bash
gnn invoice-etl --python
cd ~/Github/_local/projects/invoice-etl
# commit work…
gnp
cd ~/Github/n1ecC/invoice-etl
gmc
```

### Rules agents must follow
1. Never invent a flat `~/Github/<repo>` path. Synced remotes live under `~/Github/n1ecC/<repo>`.
2. New work with no GitHub remote yet → `gnn` / `_local/projects/`, then `gnp` when ready to publish.
3. After `gnp`, the canonical path is `~/Github/n1ecC/<repo>`; do not leave promoted repos under `_local`.
4. Do not add third-party orgs (e.g. `facebook`) to `.mirror-owners`. Use `gnc` for read-only clones; `gnf` to contribute.
5. Before promote/push: ensure `.gitignore` covers `.venv/`, `node_modules/`, `.env`, large data; never commit secrets.
6. Prefer `gmc` / `gns` to verify layout instead of ad-hoc `find` when diagnosing missing clones.

## 9. Worktree & PR Lifecycle (mandatory)

All development happens in workmux-managed git worktrees (`.worktrees/`, one branch and one tmux window per worktree; manage with `wmux`). At the end of development, before the user removes the worktree (`wmr`) and prunes:
1. Commit all work on the worktree's branch (Conventional Commits).
2. Push and open a PR: `git push -u origin <branch>`, then `gh pr create` with a title under 70 characters, a summary body, and a test plan.
3. Report the PR URL. Done = PR URL reported. The user merges the PR, then runs `wmr` and `git worktree prune` themselves.
